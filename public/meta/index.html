<p>This website is generated using <a
href="https://github.com/jpesce/miu">miu</a>, a very simple static site
generator written from the ground up. This page serves as a high-level
documentation of how the generator works and the thoughts that went in
when creating it. It was written in hopes that it might be useful for
someone attempting to or already building one such program. It was also
written for myself as a <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/320581-writing-is-thinking-to-write-well-is-to-think-clearly">way
of reflecting about it</a> and to serve as an assistant for future
iterations.</p>
<h2 id="why-build-a-site-generator">Why build a site generator?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Learn a (new) programming language. In my case I wanted to see what
<a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> looked like, so it seemed like a fun
thing to do.</li>
<li>Explore the core elements of developing a website. Some would argue
that today’s popular ways of building websites are just <a
href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/everything-easy/">too damn
complex</a> and I have a hunch that some developers have no idea what’s
going on behind the curtains a lot of the times. By creating your own
tools, you are able to gain an clearer understanding of the process and
possibly cultivate both an appreciation and criticism for other
toolchains.</li>
<li>Don’t go full bare-bones. Maintaining a moderately complex website
in pure HTML/CSS may prove to be a suicidal task.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>
<p>miu is both a Japanese given name (美宇) and a <a
href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/mu">pronunciation</a>
for the greek letter μ. The letter μ is used as a unit prefix denoting a
factor of 10<sup>−6</sup> (one millionth) or, in other words, it’s very
tiny. It’s also the coefficient of friction, which is the principle by
which some (electro)static generator machines work, so it fits the theme
of static (site) generators nicely. I guess a loose translation could be
“a very tiny thing that generates static stuff”.</p>
<h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>
<p>Here’s a high-level overview of the different modules that comprise
the generator:</p>

<h2 id="high-level-understanding">High-level understanding</h2>
<p>In miu, content is stored as plain-text markdown files aiming for
easy migration and enhanced longevity. Templates provide both a way to
reuse sections such as the header and a way to generate special pages
such as the index. The build pipeline orchestrate things acting like the
controller in the <a
href="https://wiki.c2.com/?WhatsaControllerAnyway">modern understading
of the MVC architecture</a>.</p>

<li>Assets such as stylesheets, favicons and global images are copied
directly</li>
<li>Markdown content is compiled to HTML and placed in their
templates</li>
<li>Markdown images are optimized</li>
<li>Index is generated based on the content that was previously
built</li>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<dl>
<dt>If it’s so simple, why not go even more bare-bones and do it as bash
scripts?</dt>
<dd>
I’ve done that in a project innocently named <a
href="https://github.com/jpesce/shite/">shite</a> (shell + site) and it
was fun! I enjoyed a lot but felt I wasn’t fluent enough in the
language. Making simple things that would be trivial in other
programming languages felt like a struggle. But I’d love to tackle that
again some day.
